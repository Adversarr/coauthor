In this paper, we presented CoAuthor, a system for intelligent collaborative academic writing using large language models. Our approach combines event-sourced architecture with agent-based workflows to provide a transparent and reproducible writing environment.

We described the system's hexagonal architecture, which separates domain logic from infrastructure concerns, and detailed the tool-based interaction model that enables safe and controlled collaboration between human authors and AI agents.

Future work will focus on several key areas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Context Management}: Improving how the system maintains and utilizes context across long-form documents.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Agent Collaboration}: Extending the architecture to support multiple specialized agents working concurrently.
    \item \textbf{Integration with External Tools}: Connecting with reference managers, data visualization tools, and other research software.
    \item \textbf{User Studies}: Conducting larger-scale evaluations to better understand user needs and optimize the interface design.
\end{itemize}

We believe that systems like CoAuthor represent an important step toward more effective human-AI collaboration in knowledge work, and we look forward to continuing development in this exciting area.
