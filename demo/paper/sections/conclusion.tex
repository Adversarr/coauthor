We presented Seed as a domain-agnostic assistant-team runtime for local workspace execution. By combining event-sourced lifecycle management, explicit tool auditing, and human-in-the-loop risk controls, Seed provides a practical path to reliable goal execution with LLM agents.

Future work includes richer delegation strategies, stronger domain packs, and broader longitudinal evaluation across real-world user workflows.
