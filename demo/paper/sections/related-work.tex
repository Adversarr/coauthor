\subsection{AI-Assisted Writing}
\label{subsec:ai-writing}

Recent advances in large language models have enabled new possibilities for automated text generation. Systems such as GPT-4 and Claude have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent, contextually appropriate text across various domains.

\subsection{Collaborative Authoring Systems}
\label{subsec:collaborative}

Collaborative writing platforms have evolved significantly since the introduction of Google Docs and similar real-time editing systems. These platforms typically use operational transformation (OT) or conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to manage concurrent edits.

\subsection{Event Sourcing in Document Management}
\label{subsec:event-sourcing}

Event sourcing has gained traction as an architectural pattern for systems requiring complete audit trails and temporal queries. By storing state changes as a sequence of events, systems can reconstruct past states and maintain comprehensive histories.
