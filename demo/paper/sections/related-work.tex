\subsection{General AI Assistants}
\label{subsec:ai-assistants}

Modern assistants provide strong single-turn generation, but reliable multi-step execution still depends on explicit state models, tool boundaries, and user checkpoints.

\subsection{Collaborative Task Systems}
\label{subsec:collaborative}

Task systems commonly focus on issue tracking or workflow routing. Seed extends this with runtime orchestration where LLM-generated plans, tool actions, and user interactions are all represented in a replayable lifecycle.

\subsection{Event Sourcing in Execution Platforms}
\label{subsec:event-sourcing}

Event-sourced architectures provide durable history, deterministic replay, and clearer debugging for systems with long-running workflows and asynchronous interactions. These properties are especially useful for assistant-mediated execution.
