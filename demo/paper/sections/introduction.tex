% Introduction Section
% Overview of the problem and contribution

Knowledge work now spans code, documents, operations, and planning tasks that are increasingly assisted by LLM tools. Despite strong model capabilities, many systems still lack explicit control surfaces, durable histories, and safe execution boundaries for high-impact actions.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{subsec:problem}

Users need assistants that can execute end-to-end goals while preserving transparency and control. In practice, this requires a runtime model that can track decisions, gate risky actions, and recover from interruptions without losing context.

\subsection{Contribution}
\label{subsec:contribution}

This document presents the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A task-driven, event-sourced orchestration model for assistant-team execution.
    \item A human-in-the-loop safety flow for risky tools using explicit confirmation.
    \item A role-based agent team design with coordinator, research, and chat specialists.
\end{enumerate}
