% Introduction Section
% This section provides an overview of the research problem and contribution

The field of academic writing has seen significant transformation with the advent of large language models. Researchers now have access to powerful tools that can assist with drafting, editing, and refining scholarly content. However, integrating these tools into existing workflows presents unique challenges.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{subsec:problem}

Current approaches to AI-assisted writing often lack transparency, making it difficult for researchers to understand and verify the contributions made by automated systems. Additionally, collaboration between human authors and AI agents requires careful coordination to maintain academic integrity.

\subsection{Contribution}
\label{subsec:contribution}

This paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A novel event-sourced architecture for tracking changes in collaborative writing scenarios.
    \item An agent-based workflow that enables transparent interaction between human authors and AI assistants.
    \item A prototype implementation demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.
\end{enumerate}
