\subsection{Methodology}
\label{subsec:methodology}

We evaluated Seed through representative workspace tasks requiring discovery, analysis, and controlled edits. Each task was assessed for traceability, user control, and completion reliability.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsec:results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Users could follow task progress through explicit state transitions and logs.
    \item UIP confirmation reduced accidental high-impact operations.
    \item Event replay and audit records improved debugging and trust.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Evaluation scope remains limited to local workflows.
    \item Quantitative benchmarking across diverse domains is still pending.
    \item Multi-agent policy optimization is currently basic.
\end{enumerate}
