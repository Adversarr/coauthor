% This section describes the methodology and results of our evaluation

\subsection{Methodology}
\label{subsec:methodology}

We evaluated CoAuthor through a series of controlled writing tasks designed to assess the system's effectiveness in supporting collaborative academic writing. Participants were asked to complete specific document revision tasks using the CoAuthor interface.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsec:results}

Our preliminary evaluation shows promising results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Participants were able to complete revision tasks efficiently using the tool-based workflow.
    \item The event-sourced architecture provided clear audit trails that helped users understand the evolution of documents.
    \item The UIP confirmation mechanism for risky operations was well-received, providing appropriate safety controls.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}

We acknowledge several limitations in our current evaluation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The evaluation was conducted with a small set of participants.
    \item Tasks were relatively simple and may not reflect the complexity of real-world academic writing.
    \item Long-term usage patterns and user retention were not assessed.
\end{enumerate}
