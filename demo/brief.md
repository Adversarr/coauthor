# Seed Demo Brief

## Objective

Demonstrate Seed as a personal AI assistant team for general workspace execution.

## Scenario

A user asks Seed to improve clarity in `demo/data/sample.txt`.

Expected execution pattern:
1. Inspect relevant files.
2. Propose one focused edit.
3. Require user confirmation for the risky edit.
4. Apply and summarize outcome.

## Why This Matters

This validates the core Seed promises:
- explicit task lifecycle,
- auditable tool actions,
- human-in-the-loop safety,
- domain-agnostic goal execution.

## Optional Domain Extension

`demo/paper/` remains as an optional writing-domain sample; it is not the primary Seed positioning.
